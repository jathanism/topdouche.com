Top Douche
==========

Concept
=======

It's based upon a game we started playing while looking at people's about.me
profiles here in the office.  We noticed there were classic things that people
were doing with their profile pics to try to make themselves look cool.  

Stuff like wearing sunglasses, being at the beach, in front of a mountain, on an
exotic travel adventure, wearing revealing clothes, looking sexy, smoking,
drinking, being elevated and looking down, being on a boat, wearing an ascot,
wearing a hat indoors, using props, being on stage, using a black & white or
sepia filter, looking "cool", etc...  

The image that people paint for themselves online is really interesting and
also ripe for comedy.  We started assigning points for elements of "douchiness"
and were able to grade about.me profiles that way.  But I think the idea could
be applied beyond just about.me profiles and to web identity profile pages in
general.
